# SingletonPractice

## Description
* Uses the singleton pattern to create a API Manager singleton. The manager performs an api call, passes the result in a completion handler, and uses the data to be displayed on the screen.

# What I Learned
* Private init's main purpose to prevent instantiation of the Singletons. 
* In some instances, a class can be instantiated to create an instance different from the singleton to accomodate the amount of data being received.
